        <h1>Why Your Contents Never Make It <br> To The Top On The First Page</h1>
        <p>A lot of people write, but not all written contents yield conversion. The possibility of your <br> content being effectively read by the right people is greatly determined by <br> how well google ranks your content in the Search Engine Result Page (SERP)      
        </p>
        <p><b>Google requires that your content must contain the required keywords, as this goes a long way <br> determining how much time users spend reading the content on your website. <br> However, such content must also be detailed, information and relevant to the users search interest.
        </b></p>
        <H2>Google Criteria For A Good Content</H2>
        <p>For your content to be worthy enough to grace its first page, and more importantly, <br> be among the top most results searched by users, google has some criteria that must be met. <br> Some of these criteria include but are not limited to the following:
        </p>
        <p>    - Relevant Keywords</p>
        <p>    - Time Spent By Users</p>
        <p>    - How Detailed And Informative The Content Is</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Relevant Keywords</h3>
        <img src="./keywords.png" height = "300" width = "300" alt="">
         <p>Google considers how relevant your  content is to the user. For instance, if a user enters the <br> "Skin Care Products For A Dark Skin" in the search box, your content can only <br> come up if the words in the users search interest are richly contained in your content. 
        </p>
        <p>So, a good way to get relevant keywords on a particular subject matter is to use Uber Suggest. Here, you can know <br> the kind of words that are being used by a lot of cyber customers in searching for what interests them. <br> This way, your content will have the right keywords, and your content will get more recognition.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Time Spent By Users</h3>
        <img src="./time.png" height = "300" width = "300" alt="">
        <p>This works hand in hand with how relevant your keywords are. For instance, a user can only spend more time <br> on a page or content that right answers the user's question. But, having the right keywords isn't enough. You must <br> note that how optimized your content is also goes a long way in determining the interest of the user. 
        </p>
        <p>Your content must be structured in such a way that the user knows where to go to get some relevant <br> information. Using headings and bullet points would go a long way in optimizing your content and increasing <br> the user experience of the users. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>How Detailed An Informative The Content Is</h3>
        <img src="./relevant.png" height = "300" width = "300" alt="">
        <p>It is not enough to have relevant keywords and good headlines in your content, you must also ensure that you are passing <br> across factual information. The content of your work must be passing across very useful information in a detailed and understanding manner. <br> Your writing language must be simple so that everyone would be able to read and understand. 
        </p>
        <p>The information you pass across should also not be randomly found online. This is why you must be <br> tight on your research skill and try to be creative in the way you collate your content. The truth is you might <br> not come up with anything new, but the difference lies in how you structure what you know.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If your content has never made it up to the top in the Search Engine Result Page (SERP), <br> apply the technique above and watch your page grow.
