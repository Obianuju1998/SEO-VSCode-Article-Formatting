        <h1>Why Your Contents Never Make It To The Top On The First Page</h1>
        <p>A lot of people write, but not all written contents yield conversion. The possibility of your content being effectively read by the right people is greatly determined by how well google ranks your content in the Search Engine Result Page (SERP)      
        </p>
        <p><b>Google requires that your content must contain the required keywords, as this goes a long way determining how much time users spend reading the content on your website. However, such content must also be detailed, information and relevant to the users search interest.
        </b></p>
        <H2>Google Criteria For A Good Content</H2>
        <p>For your content to be worthy enough to grace its first page, and more importantly, be among the top most results searched by users, google has some criteria that must be met. Some of these criteria include but are not limited to the following:
        </p>
        <p>    - Relevant Keywords</p>
        <p>    - Time Spent By Users</p>
        <p>    - How Detailed And Informative The Content Is</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Relevant Keywords</h3>
        <img src="./keywords.png" height = "300" width = "300" alt="">
         <p>Google considers how relevant your  content is to the user. For instance, if a user enters the "Skin Care Products For A Dark Skin" in the search box, your content can only come up if the words in the users search interest are richly contained in your content. 
        </p>
        <p>So, a good way to get relevant keywords on a particular subject matter is to use Uber Suggest. Here, you can know the kind of words that are being used by a lot of cyber customers in searching for what interests them. This way, your content will have the right keywords, and your content will get more recognition.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Time Spent By Users</h3>
        <img src="./time.png" height = "300" width = "300" alt="">
        <p>This works hand in hand with how relevant your keywords are. For instance, a user can only spend more time on a page or content that right answers the user's question. But, having the right keywords isn't enough. You must note that how optimized your content is also goes a long way in determining the interest of the user. 
        </p>
        <p>Your content must be structured in such a way that the user knows where to go to get some relevant information. Using headings and bullet points would go a long way in optimizing your content and increasing the user experience of the users. 
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>How Detailed An Informative The Content Is</h3>
        <img src="./relevant.png" height = "300" width = "300" alt="">
        <p>It is not enough to have relevant keywords and good headlines in your content, you must also ensure that you are passing across factual information. The content of your work must be passing across very useful information in a detailed and understanding manner. Your writing language must be simple so that everyone would be able to read and understand. 
        </p>
        <p>The information you pass across should also not be randomly found online. This is why you must be tight on your research skill and try to be creative in the way you collate your content. The truth is you might not come up with anything new, but the difference lies in how you structure what you know.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If your content has never made it up to the top in the Search Engine Result Page (SERP), apply the technique above and watch your page grow. Know who you are writing to always place yourself in their shoes. In other words, write what you would want to read.
